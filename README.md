# ionic-cordova-plugins-demo
Some demos of multiple cordova/ionic plugins.

## Set up
### Install ionic
First, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Then, install the latest [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [Ionic command-line tools](https://npmjs.org/package/ionic). Follow the [Android](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/guide/platforms/android/index.html) and [iOS](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/guide/platforms/ios/index.html) platform guides to install required platform dependencies.
> Note: iOS development requires Mac OS X. iOS simulator through the Ionic CLI requires the ios-sim npm package, which can be installed with the command `npm -g install ios-sim`. If you want to deploy your app on a real iOS device install ios-deploy with the command `npm -g install ios-deploy`.

### Start an Ionic App
The basic app start for Ionic is well documented [here](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/start.html) and by read the Ionic CLI help with `ionic --help`. But this is a good start for me:

```bash
$ ionic start -sass ionicCordovaPluginsDemo sidemenu
```

### Update Ionic lib
Update Ionic library files, which are found in the `www/lib/ionic` directory. If bower is being used
by the project, this command will automatically run `bower update ionic`, otherwise this command updates
the local static files from Ionicâ€™s CDN.

```bash
$ ionic lib update
```

### Setup Ionic with device
android-sdk could be easily installed with brew, but not android-platform-tools (it is the tricky part).
```bash
$ brew install android-sdk
```

If you run `ionic run android --device` it will make an error like:
```
ERROR: Error: Please install Android target: "android-22".

Hint: Open the SDK manager by running: /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/24.2/bin/android
You will require:
1. "SDK Platform" for android-22
2. "Android SDK Platform-tools (latest)
3. "Android SDK Build-tools" (latest)
```

To solve this you have to install required SDK by selecting them using:
```bash
$ android-sdk
```

Enable the liveReload and the log on the device:
```bash
ionic run android --device -l -c
```
